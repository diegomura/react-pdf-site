## Installation

Starting with react-pdf is extremely simple.
First, install the _core_ package:

```
yarn add @react-pdf/core
```

Afterwards, you will need to install the correct bindings to target the desired platform. These come in three different flavours:

```
yarn add @react-pdf/node
yarn add @react-pdf/dom
yarn add @react-pdf/mobile
```

<NavigationButtons
  nextSrc="/quick-start-guide"
  nextText="Quick start guide"
/>
