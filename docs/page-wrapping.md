### Page wrapping

Semantically, the `<Page />` component represents a single page in the rendered document. However, there are scenarios in which you would expect to have page breaks whenever the page contents exceed their limits, specially when handling big chunks of text. After all, PDFs are paged documents. React-pdf has a built-in wrapping engine that is enabled by default, so you can start creating paged documents right out of the box. If that's not what you need, you can disable this very easily by doing:

```
import { Document, Page } from '@react-pdf/renderer'

const doc = () => (
  <Document>
    <Page wrap={false}>
      // something pretty here
    </Page>
  </Document>
);
```

<GoToExample name="page-wrap" />

#### Breakable vs. unbreakable components

We can identify two different types of components based on how they wrap:

- `Breakable components` try to fill up the remaining space before jumping into a new page. By default, this group is composed by _View_, _Text_ and _Link_ components
- `Unbreakable components` are indivisible, therefore if there isn't enough space for them they just get rendered in the following page. In this group by default we only find _Image_.

<GoToExample name="breakable-unbreakable" />

#### Disabling component wrapping

React-pdf also enables you to transform _breakable_ elements into their opposite, forcing them to always render in a new page. This can be done by simply setting the prop `wrap={false}` to any valid component:

```
import { Document, Page, View } from '@react-pdf/renderer'

const doc = () => (
  <Document>
    <Page wrap>
      <View wrap={false}>
        // fancy things here
      </View>
    </Page>
  </Document>
);
```

Now, if the `<View />` component happens to be at the bottom of the page without enough space, it will be rendered in a new page as it would be _unbreakable_.

#### Page breaks

Page breaks are useful for separating concerns inside the document, or ensuring that a certain element will always show up on the top of the page.

Adding page breaks in react-pdf is very simple: all you have to do is add the `break` prop to any primitive. This will force the wrapping algorithm to start a new page when rendering that element.

```
import { Document, Page, Text } from '@react-pdf/renderer'

const doc = () => (
  <Document>
    <Page wrap>
      <Text break>
        // fancy things here
      </Text>
    </Page>
  </Document>
);
```

<GoToExample name="page-breaks" />

#### Fixed components

There is still another scenario we didn't talk about yet: what if you want to wrap pages but also be able to render a component on _all_ pages? This is where the `fixed` prop comes into play.

```
import { Document, Page, View } from '@react-pdf/renderer'

const doc = () => (
  <Document>
    <Page wrap>
      <View fixed>
        // fancy things here
      </View>
    </Page>
  </Document>
);
```

Just by that, the `<View />` component will be placed repeatedly throughout all pages.

> **Protip:** This feature can be very handy for creating nice headers, footers or page numbers, among other use cases. You can even absolutely position fixed elements on your page to create more complex layouts!
