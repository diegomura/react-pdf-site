### Bookmarks `v2.2.0`

Bookmarks allow the user to navigate interactively from one part of the document to another. They form a tree-structured hierarchy of items, which serve as a visual table of contents to display the documentâ€™s structure to the user.

A bookmark can be defined by the `bookmark` prop on any of the supported components ([see more](/components)), and can take the form of either a _String_ or a _Bookmark_ type

```js
import { Document, Page, Text } from '@react-pdf/renderer'

const doc = () => (
  <Document>
    <Page bookmark="Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone">
     <Text bookmark={{ title: "Chapter 1: The Boy Who Lived", fit: true }}>{...}</Text>
    </Page>
  </Document>
);
```

The example above will create a table of content of 2 nested items: The parent will be the book's name, and the child the chapter's name. You can nest as many bookmarks as you want.
